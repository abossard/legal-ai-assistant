---  
   
The inserted minor compliance issues are as follows:  
   
1. **Intellectual Property Rights**: The clause stating "Any pre-existing intellectual property rights of the Supplier required for the Services shall be disclosed and licensed appropriately to Customer, unless such rights are proprietary and confidential to the Supplier." This introduces ambiguity because it suggests that Supplier may withhold licensing rights for proprietary and confidential intellectual property, which may not align with ABB GTC's requirement for the Customer to be granted rights to use Embedded Software.  
   
2. **Term and Termination**: The addition of "or for convenience with 90 days written notice" may not be compliant with the ABB GTC, which specifies the conditions under which the Customer may terminate the Contract. The ABB GTC may not include termination for convenience, or may have different notice requirements.  
   
These issues should be revised to ensure full compliance with the ABB GTC.
