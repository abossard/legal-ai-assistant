even if that party was aware of the possibility that such loss or damage might be incurred by the other.

19.1 Except as otherwise provided in the Order, Reseller may termi- nate all Reseller Agreements or any individual Reseller Agreement:

19.1.1 for convenience in whole or in part by giving Supplier thirty (30) days written Notice;

19.1.2 if an End User terminates its End User Contract with Reseller by giving the Supplier (10) days written Notice.

In such events, Reseller shall pay to Supplier the value of the delivered but unpaid Products. No further compensation will be due to Supplier.

19.2 Either party may terminate the Reseller Agreement for cause and with no liability to the other party with immediate effect by giving written Notice to the other party if:

19.2.1 the other party commits a material breach of the respective Re- seller Agreement which (in the case of a breach capable of remedy) it does not remedy within thirty (30) calendar days of receiving written Notice of the breach; or

19.2.2 the other party takes any step or action in connection with its entering administration, liquidation or any arrangement with its credi- tors (other than in relation to a solvent restructuring), being wound up (unless for the purpose of a solvent restructuring), having a receiver appointed to any of its assets or ceasing to carry on business or, if the step or action is taken in another jurisdiction, in connection with any analogous procedure in the relevant jurisdiction.

19.3 In addition, Reseller shall have the right to terminate the Re- seller Agreement(s) and/or all Reseller Agreements for cause and with no liability to the other party with immediate effect if the Supplier un- dergoes a Change of Control to a competitor of any member of the Re- seller Group. For purposes of this Clause 19.3, a "Change of Control" occurs if either (i) the majority of shares carrying a right to vote in the Supplier or its parent company(ies) are acquired by a person who is not at the date entering into a Reseller Agreement a majority shareholder, or (ii) there is a change in the ownership of the legal power to direct, or determine the direction of, the general management and policies of the Supplier or its parent company(ies).

19.4 The termination of the Reseller Agreement(s) and/or the GTC, however arising, will be without prejudice to the rights and duties of either party accrued prior to termination.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Reseller Agreement, Supplier shall, without any limitations, indemnify and hold harmless Reseller for all liabilities, damages, cost or expenses incurred as a result of any such violation and termination of the Reseller Agreement, or arising from export restrictions concealed by Supplier.
