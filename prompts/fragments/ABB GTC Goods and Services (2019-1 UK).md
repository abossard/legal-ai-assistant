3.3 When Customer (or a Customer Affiliate at a relevant Delivery Lo- cation) identifies quality related issues on the part of Supplier, Cus- tomer (or Customer Affiliate) will notify Supplier thereof. Notwith- standing other remedies available to Customer under the Contract, Cus- tomer may instruct Supplier to undertake at Supplier's risk and expense an analysis into the root cause(s) of the quality related issues; such anal- ysis being undertaken and reported to Customer within ten (10) calen- dar days of the notification of the quality related issue(s). Customer reserves the right to undertake an audit (carried out by Customer's nominated personnel, which may include third party experts or Cus- tomer Affiliate staff) of Supplier based on the results of the root cause analysis or where Supplier fails to comply with this Clause. Supplier shall also pro-actively advise Customer if it becomes aware of any quality related issues that may affect the Goods and/or Services, and the provisions of this Clause 3.3 shall otherwise apply as if the issue had been notified by Customer.

3.4 Customer may issue Variation Orders to Supplier, and Supplier shall carry out such Variation Orders.

Any Supplier claim for adjustment under this Clause will be deemed waived unless asserted within thirty (30) calendar days from Supplier's receipt of the Variation Order. Variation Orders requested by Supplier only become effective after written confirmation by Customer.

As soon as possible after receipt of a request for a variation, Supplier shall notify Customer in writing whether and how the variation can be carried out, stating the resulting alteration to the Order price, the time for completion and other terms of the Contract. Supplier shall not commence work on any varia- tion until it has received a Variation Order from Customer instructing that variation.

14.1 Customer may terminate the Contract for convenience in whole or in part by giving Supplier thirty (30) calendar days written notice. In such event Customer shall pay to Supplier the value of the delivered but unpaid Goods and/or Services (provided that such Goods and/or Services otherwise comply with the Contract) and proven direct costs reasonably incurred by Supplier for undelivered Goods and/or Ser- vices, however in no event more than the price for the Goods and/or Services agreed under the Contract.

15\. FORCE MAJEURE
==================

15.1 Neither Party (nor any Customer Affiliate receiving the Goods and/or Services) will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its

obligations under a Contract if the delay or failure results from an event of Force Majeure. Force Majeure means an event that was not fore- seeable by the affected Party (or Customer Affiliate) at the time of ex- ecution of the Contract, is unavoidable and outside the reasonable con- trol of the affected Party (or Customer Affiliate), provided that it cannot overcome such event despite all reasonable efforts, and that it provides notice to the other Party (and, in the case of Supplier being affected, to any relevant Customer Affiliate) within five (5) calendar days from oc- currence of the Force Majeure event. The affected Party shall give no- tice in writing to the other Party without delay upon cessation of the event of Force Majeure. If a Party fails to give such notices, the other Party shall be entitled to compensation for any additional costs which it incurs and which it could have avoided had it received such notice.

15.2 If a Force Majeure event exceeds thirty (30) calendar days, either Party may terminate the Contract forthwith by written notice without liability. Each Party shall use reasonable efforts to minimise the effects of the Force Majeure event.
