installation, removal or assembly and dismantling costs) and risk.

8.6 In case of a breach of any warranty, the warranty period shall be extended by a time period which is equal to the time period for the performance of the remedial work by Supplier.

directors/officers or employees, to business partners, public officials or any third party in a manner contrary to applicable laws (including but not limited to German Law, the U. S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act 2010 and, where applicable, legislation enacted by member states and signatories implementing the OECD Convention Combating Bribery of Foreign Officials).

channels/how-do-i-report. Supplier ensures that these reporting channels are used to report suspected violations.

10.13 Any breach of any of the obligations contained in Sections 10.6 to 10.9 shall be deemed a material breach of the Contract. A material breach by either Party entitles the other

Party to terminate the Contract immediately and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies under this Contract or applicable law. This also applies if the Supplier refuses, frustrates or impedes training or further education according to Section 10.9 or an examination according to Section 10.10 and does not immediately make it possible in full at the request of the Customer.

Supplier shall ensure that such employees, agents, Subcontractors or other third parties are subject to and comply with the same obligations of confidentiality as applicable to Supplier and will be liable for any unauthorized disclosures.

11.2 To protect the Customer Data, Supplier shall apply appropriate safeguards, adequate to the type of Customer Data to be protected, against the unauthorised access or disclosure of such data and protect such Customer Data in accordance with the generally accepted standards of protection in the related indus try, or in the same manner and to the same degree that it protects its own confidential and proprietary information - whichever standard is higher.
