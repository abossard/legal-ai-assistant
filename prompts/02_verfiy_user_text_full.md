3.8 Customer is authorized to make, or procure the making of, any pay- ments due to Supplier's employees and subcontractors providing Goods and/or Services under the Contract, in order to avoid lawsuits, liens or encumbrances. Such payments may be made through withhold- ing Supplier's credits, offsetting or in any other way. Supplier shall provide any support requested by Customer with regard to such pay- ments and indemnify and hold harmless Customer and its Affiliates for any payments made.

4\. PAYMENT, INVOICING
----------------------

4.1 In consideration of the Goods delivered and/or the Services pro- vided by Supplier in accordance with the Contract, Customer shall pay to Supplier the purchase price stated in the Contract provided the in- voice fulfils the requirements defined by Customer. Payment shall be made in the country in which Supplier is registered, to a bank account in the name of Supplier. The price is inclusive of all fees and taxes (other than VAT or equivalent) and of all costs of manufacturing, pro- cessing, warehousing and packaging (including returning any returna- ble packaging) of any Goods.

4.2 Supplier shall submit invoices in an auditable form, complying with applicable laws, generally accepted accounting principles and the spe- cific Customer requirements, containing the following minimum infor- mation: Supplier name, address and reference person including contact details; invoice date; invoice number; Order number and Supplier num- ber; address of Customer; quantity; specification of Goods and/or Ser- vices; price (total amount invoiced); currency; tax or VAT amount; tax or VAT number; Authorized Economic Operator and/or Approved Ex- porter Authorization number and/or other customs identification num- ber, if applicable; payment terms as agreed. Supplier shall state the Or- der number on all invoices (in particular but not limited to commercial, pro forma or customs invoices).

4.3 Invoices must be sent to the billing address specified in the Contract (or as otherwise agreed with Customer).

4.4 Customer shall pay the invoice in accordance with the payment terms agreed in the Contract.

4.5 Customer will reimburse expenses only at cost and to the extent agreed in writing.

4.6 Services charged on the basis of hourly rates require written confir- mation of Supplier's time sheets by Customer. Supplier shall submit such time sheets to Customer for confirmation as may be instructed by Customer but latest together with any related invoice. Confirmation of time sheets cannot be construed as acknowledgement of any claims. Customer is not obliged to pay invoices based on time sheets which are not confirmed by Customer in writing.

4.7 Customer reserves the right to set off or withhold payment for Goods and/or Services not provided in accordance with the Contract. 4.8 If an invoice received by Customer is not paid by the due date, Sup- plier may give notice in writing that the amount is overdue. Thirty (30) days after receipt of notice, unless the payment is disputed in good faith by Customer, Supplier may charge interest at the rate of 3% above the 3-month LIBOR rate (for unsecured USD loans) on any unpaid and undisputed amount, from the date payment fell due (or such other date as may be agreed in writing between the Parties), until receipt of the amount owed. Supplier acknowledges and agrees that this Clause 4.8 provides Supplier with a substantial remedy in respect of any late pay- ment of sums due under any Contract.

5\. DELIVERY, PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES
-------------------------------------

5.1 Unless agreed otherwise in the Contract, the Goods shall be deliv- ered in accordance with INCOTERMS 2020 FCA, to the Delivery Lo- cation.

5.2 The Services shall be provided at the Delivery Location.

5.3 Supplier shall provide, no later than at the time of acceptance of the Contract, the following minimum information: number of packages and contents, the customs tariff numbers of the country of consignment, and the countries of origin for all Goods. For controlled Goods, the relevant national export control numbers must be indicated and, if the Goods and/or Services are subject to U.S. export regulations, the U.S. Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCN) or classification numbers of

the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) must be speci- fied. Proofs of preferential origin as well as conformity declarations and marks of the country of consignment or destination are to be sub- mitted without being requested; certificates of origin upon request.

5.4 The Goods shall be delivered, and Services shall be provided, dur- ing Customer's business hours (or those of the requested Delivery Lo- cation) unless otherwise requested by Customer.

5.5 Upon Delivery, Supplier (or its appointed carrier) shall provide Customer (or, if requested, any nominated Customer Affiliate at the Delivery Location) a delivery note and any other required export and import documents not mentioned in Clause 5.3. If Customer has ap- proved partial delivery, such delivery note shall also include the out- standing balance.

5.6 Ownership of the Goods passes to Customer at Delivery. To the extent that the Goods contain Embedded Software, ownership of such Embedded Software will not pass to Customer, but Supplier shall grant, or - as applicable - shall procure that the third party owner grants, Cus- tomer and all users a worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, transferable, non-exclusive, royalty-free right to use the Embedded Software as in- tegral part of such Goods and/or for servicing either of them. For the avoidance of doubt, Supplier shall have no rights of retention of title, and Supplier will convey good title to the Goods, free of any liens or encumbrances (but transfer of title and ownership in the Goods to Cus- tomer shall not release Customer from its obligation to pay for those Goods, in accordance with the terms of the Contract).

### 6\. ACCEPTANCE

6.1 Delivery of Goods or provision of Services shall not be deemed to be acceptance of such Goods or Services by Customer. Customer (or its nominated Customer Affiliate at the Delivery Location) shall have reasonable time to inspect or test the Goods and/or Services and to re- port any defects to Supplier. If a defect in the Goods and/or Services was not reasonably detectable during the inspection, Customer (or its nominated Customer Affiliate at the Delivery Location) shall have rea- sonable time to provide notice of such defect after it has become appar- ent and/or to reject the Goods and/or Services.

6.2 The Parties may agree on a certain acceptance procedure, in which case acceptance will be subject to Customer's written acceptance state- ment (or that of Customer's nominated Affiliate). Supplier shall inform Customer (and any relevant Customer Affiliate) in writing within a rea- sonable time period in advance when the Goods and/or Services are ready for acceptance.

6.3 Customer may enforce any remedy defined in the Contract for any rejected Goods or Services.

7\. DELAY
---------

Supplier will deliver Goods in accordance with any date or time, and at least in accordance with any lead times, specified in the Contract. If the Delivery of Goods or the provision of Services does not comply with the agreed date(s), Customer may:

7.1 terminate the Contract in whole or in part;

7.2 refuse any subsequent delivery of the Goods or provision of the Services;

7.3 recover from Supplier any expenses reasonably incurred by Cus- tomer (or any affected Customer Affiliate) in obtaining the Goods and/or Services in substitution from another supplier;

7.4 claim damages for any cost, loss, expenses and liquidated damages incurred by Customer (or by any affected Customer Affiliate) which are attributable to Supplier's delay;

7.5 claim liquidated damages as agreed in the Contract;

and it is agreed that Customer may select one or more such remedies, and recovering costs or damages under any of Clauses 7.3 to 7.5 shall not exclude Customer from recovering other costs or damages under the other parts of this Clause 7.

Upon Customer's request Supplier shall defend Customer (or any rele- vant Customer Affiliate) against any third party claims.

12.3.2 public and products liability insurance with a minimum liabil- ity of not less than five million GBP (£ 5,000,000) for any one event.

13\. ANTICIPATED NON-PERFORMANCE
--------------------------------

Notwithstanding other provisions in the ABB GTC regarding suspen- sion, Customer shall be entitled to suspend performance of its obliga- tions under the Contract, where it is clear from the circumstances that Supplier is not going to perform its obligations. Customer shall forth- with notify Supplier of the suspension in writing.

14\. TERMINATION
================

14.1 Customer may terminate the Contract for convenience in whole or in part by giving Supplier thirty (30) calendar days written notice. In such event Customer shall pay to Supplier the value of the delivered but unpaid Goods and/or Services (provided that such Goods and/or Services otherwise comply with the Contract) and proven direct costs reasonably incurred by Supplier for undelivered Goods and/or Ser- vices, however in no event more than the price for the Goods and/or Services agreed under the Contract.

14.4 Upon termination Supplier shall immediately and at Supplier's ex- pense return to Customer (or Customer's Affiliate) all Customer or Customer Affiliate property (including any Customer Data, documen- tation, and transfer of Intellectual Property Rights) then under Sup- plier's control and provide Customer (or its nominated Affiliate) with the complete documentation about the Goods and/or Services.

15\. FORCE MAJEURE
==================

15.1 Neither Party (nor any Customer Affiliate receiving the Goods and/or Services) will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its

obligations under a Contract if the delay or failure results from an event of Force Majeure. Force Majeure means an event that was not fore- seeable by the affected Party (or Customer Affiliate) at the time of ex- ecution of the Contract, is unavoidable and outside the reasonable con- trol of the affected Party (or Customer Affiliate), provided that it cannot overcome such event despite all reasonable efforts, and that it provides notice to the other Party (and, in the case of Supplier being affected, to any relevant Customer Affiliate) within five (5) calendar days from oc- currence of the Force Majeure event. The affected Party shall give no- tice in writing to the other Party without delay upon cessation of the event of Force Majeure. If a Party fails to give such notices, the other Party shall be entitled to compensation for any additional costs which it incurs and which it could have avoided had it received such notice.

15.2 If a Force Majeure event exceeds thirty (30) calendar days, either Party may terminate the Contract forthwith by written notice without liability. Each Party shall use reasonable efforts to minimise the effects of the Force Majeure event.

### 17\. NOTICES

Any notice must be given duly signed by registered mail, courier, fax or by e-mail to the address of the relevant Party as stated in the Contract and/or to such other address as such Party may have notified in writing (including Customer Affiliates operating at relevant Delivery Loca- tions). E-mail and fax require written confirmation of the receiving Party. Supplier's reply, correspondence, information or documentation related to the Contract must be provided in the language used in the Contract.

### 18\. WAIVERS

Failure to enforce or exercise any term of the Contract does not consti- tute a waiver of such term and does not affect the right later to enforce such or any other term therein contained.

=========================================

19.1 The Contract is governed by the laws of England, however under exclusion of its conflict of law rules and the United Nations Convention on International Sale of Goods.

21.2 The obligations set forth in Clauses 8 (Warranty and Remedies),

Supplier shall, without any limitations, indemnify and hold harmless Customer and each relevant Customer's Affiliate for any claim made by a third party against Customer in connection with the Goods and/or Services relating to a breach by Supplier, including but without limitation to claims that such Goods and/or Services infringe a third party's Intellectual Property Rights. Upon Customer's request, Supplier shall defend Customer (or any relevant Customer's Affiliate) against any such third party claims.

13. TERMINATION
13.1 Customer may terminate the Contract for convenience in whole or in part by giving Supplier thirty (30) calendar days written notice.

13.5 The ABB GTC shall not limit either Party's right provided by applicable law to terminate the Contract for cause ("aus wichtigem Grund").

13.6 Any termination or rescission of the Contract shall be in writing.

14. FORCE MAJEURE
14.1 Neither Party (nor any Customer's Affiliate receiving the Goods and/or Services) will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under the Contract if the delay or failure results from an event of Force Majeure.
